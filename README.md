# Softly
An MS Windows configuration framework

To install, run:

    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamesB797/Softly/master/install-softly.ps1 | Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList '-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass' -verb RunAs"

Installing it right now is a terrible idea, because at best all it does is download the latest salt installer to ~/Softly, which I'm going to have to change anyway.
